## GSA Standards

#### Each GSA user must

* [Activate 2-factor Authentication](https://github.com/fisma-ready/github#activate-2-factor-authentication)
* [Add your information to your account](https://github.com/fisma-ready/github#add-your-information-to-your-account)
* [Add a profile avatar](https://github.com/fisma-ready/github#add-a-profile-avatar)
* [Make your membership public](https://github.com/fisma-ready/github#make-your-membership-public)

#### Each repository should: 

* [Have a simple and useful name](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/naming-your-project/)
* [Have a user-friendly description](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/writing-the-repo-description/)
* [Have a useful README.md](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/making-readmes-readable/)

#### Standards for making a private repo:  

By default, projects in GitHub.com/GSA should be public.  They should only be made private under certain circumstances.  

* A repository can be made private if it containts information that legally cannot be made public.  

## Workflows 

#### Creating a GitHub account

1. If you haven't created a GitHub account yet (https://github.com/), do so with your government email, which will assist with [records retention](http://ben.balter.com/open-source-for-government/#records).  
2. If you already have a GitHub account, simply [add your goverment email to your existing account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account/). Do not create a new account. You can also set up custom email routing through the [Notifications Center](https://github.com/settings/notifications). Make sure your commits are [associated with your government email address](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git).
3. Update the `Settings` in your account to match the [GSA Standards](gsa-standards).
4. Note that associating commits with an email address is different from [setting notifications to go to one or another email address](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-notification-emails-for-organizations/). You also have to change the official commit email address attached to each repo.
5. If youâ€™re using your work computer for personal projects on GitHub and want your personal email tied to those commits, you can set your GSA email as part of the global `.gitconfig`, then [override on a repository level](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Configuration) with your personal email. If you have both emails [in your GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/emails), though, they will both be tied to your GitHub account.
6. Make sure you have [notifications turned on](https://github.com/settings/notifications) and make sure your notifications are set up they way you'd like them.

#### Requesting access to the GSA organization

1. Ensure that you have created a GitHub account that matches the standards above.  
2. If your group already has a team in the GSA organization, ask your point of contact to email 'mike.tanski@gsa.gov' with a cc to 'chudi.okafo@gsa.gov' and 'gerard.chelak@gsa.gov' with your Github username and request that you be given access.  
3. If your group does not yet have a team in the GSA organization, email 'mike.tanski@gsa.gov' with a cc to 'chudi.okafo@gsa.gov' and 'gerard.chelak@gsa.gov' to coordinate a team be created.  You will need to tell him the usernames of any others who should be added.   
4. You will receive a notification when you've been given access.  

#### Creating new public repositories

1. At https://github.com/GSA, Click `+ New Repository`.  
2. When choosing the repo's name, try to pick [a simple and useful name](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/naming-your-project/)
3. Include a brief description of the project.  
4. Change the repo status to `Public` unless it does must be private.  
5. It is usually convenient to check the box to `Initialize this repository with a README`.  
6. You will usually not need to worry about adding a `.gitignore`.  
7. Please choose the type of license from the dropdown.  For a description of the license types, see https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository  
8. Click Create Repository
9. If prompted, choose the most appropriate team that you are a member of that should be given permission to the repo.  

#### Creating new private repositories


...


The above directions are the same except that at step 4, you will choose Private instead of Public.  

#### Managing teams 

## Organize Agency Users

* Identify Team Leads
* Plan and implement the application of the standards 
* Ensure everyone has guidance going forward
